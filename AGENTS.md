# Agent Protocol - SmoothedSpectralAbscissa

This is an early-stage Julia package for the calculation of the
smoothed spectral abscissa (SSA) and its gradient.

## Current Scope

- Prefer simple, explicit implementations over broad abstractions. The package
  is still finding its core API.
- Keep README/docs claims aligned with the current focus when editing
  user-facing documentation.

## Julia Style

- Write small functions with one clear responsibility.
- Prefer Julia multiple dispatch over large conditional branches when behavior
  depends on model/input/recorder types.
- Use mutating functions with a `!` suffix and return `nothing` unless there is a
  clear reason to return a value. In particular, `ssa!` returns the SSA value.
- Keep allocations visible and intentional. Reuse `SSAAlloc` working
  matrices where that matches the local design.
- Keep public names, struct fields, and function signatures boring and explicit;
  avoid clever API layers while the model set is small.
- Favor deterministic behavior in tests and examples. Pass an RNG or seed local
  randomness when random behavior matters.
- Always use explicit `if` statements for conditional control flow. Do not use
  short-circuit expressions such as `condition || return`, `condition &&
  continue`, or `condition || throw(...)`.

## Documentation

- Keep executable documentation examples in `examples/` and write them as
  Literate.jl source files that can be run from top to bottom.
- Put executable setup, validation, or cleanup code that should not appear in
  the generated documentation between `## #src` marker lines. Append `#src`
  to each hidden code line so Literate actually filters it; the marker lines
  alone do not hide a block. Keep explanatory code visible.
- Suppress uninformative output in generated documentation. In particular, add
  a trailing semicolon to the final line of a code block before the next text
  block unless displaying that value is useful to the example.
- Keep prose close to the code it explains, and make examples deterministic by
  seeding or explicitly passing an RNG whenever randomness affects the result.
- When changing package behavior used by an example, update the corresponding
  Literate source rather than editing generated documentation.
- Use Makie and CairoMakie for documentation figures, with the Cairo backend
  activated for static output. Keep plotting dependencies in `docs/Project.toml`,
  never in the package or package test environment.
- Treat `docs/src/generated/` and `docs/build/` as build artifacts. Do not edit
  or commit them.
- Build documentation from the repository root:

  ```sh
  julia --project=docs -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.develop(PackageSpec(path=".")); Pkg.instantiate()'
  julia --project=docs docs/make.jl
  ```

## Testing

- Use the standard Julia package test flow:

  ```sh
  julia --project=. -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.test()'
  ```

- Every new function should have a corresponding unit test. Small helper
  functions are not exempt.
- When changing an existing function, add or update tests that capture the
  changed behavior directly. Example helpers can be tested in source-only
  `@testset`s in their Literate files; CI executes these sources separately.
- Organize tests into focused `@testset`s by component or behavior. It is fine
  to split tests into additional files and `include` them from
  `test/runtests.jl` as coverage grows.
- Test numerical behavior with explicit tolerances using `isapprox`
  rather than exact equality when floating-point roundoff is possible.
- Cover edge cases that define the matrix API contract, such as mismatched
  dimensions, smoothing parameters, reused allocation storage, and deterministic
  random inputs.

## Benchmarks

When requested, generate benchmarks as separate test files in the `benchmark/` directory.
Always compare the proposed version of a function with the previous implementations. For
consistency copy the code entirely into the benchmark script, so that it contains:
- previous implementation
- improved implementation
- current implementation loaded from the SmoothedSpectralAbscissa package.

Expose workload sizes, model parameters, initial values, and BenchmarkTools settings
as clearly named constants at the top of each benchmark script so they are easy to
control.

## Development Workflow

- Support Julia 1.10 and later; package CI tests Julia 1.10 and latest stable.
  Build and validate documentation on latest stable Julia.
- Check `git status --short` before editing and preserve unrelated user changes.
- Keep changes scoped to the requested behavior. Do not refactor inactive functions
  or files.
- Run the full package test command before finishing when code changes are made.
  If tests cannot run because dependencies or the environment are unavailable,
  report that clearly.
- For documentation-only and cosmetic edits, a test run is optional; still ensure examples and
  commands are accurate.
